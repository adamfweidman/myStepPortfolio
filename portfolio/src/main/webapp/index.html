      <h1>Adam's Personal Portfolio</h1>
      <p>This is my portfolio. I just finished sophmore year and this is my 
        first time making a webpage.</p>

      <p>I grew up in San Francisco where I went to a bilingual french school. 
        My grandmother is french so it was very important to her and my mom 
        that I was fluent in french as well. An interesting fact about me is 
        that I am an Australian citizen since my father was born and raised in 
        Sydney. In highschool I spent most of my free time playing basketball 
        and soccer, as well as playing the piano. Since going to college I've 
        taken up rock climbing, which has unintentionally replaced soccer. 
        I've met some of my closest friends through rock climbing and have 
        really enjoyed our trips together when we go climbing outside. I have 
        a twin sister who goes to Boston University, she's my favorite study 
        and travel buddy. 
      </p>

      <p>I now attend the University of Pennsylvania where I'm studying Math 
        and Computer Science. I had no computer science experience going into 
        college and actually thought I would double major in Math and Physics;
         I would take some CS courses to help with data analysis. But after my 
         first programming class I realized that I was more interested in 
         studying CS than physics.

      <p>During these trying times I find myself doing two things most of the 
        time: spending time with my dog and eating.<p>

      <p>Here are some photos of my dog luna enjoying the sun:</p>

        scrumptious: </p>

           activities. 
             <ul>
                <li>I love to Lake Tahoe because in the winter it has great 
                  skiing and during the summer the lake is warm
             enough to swim in!</li>
                <li>I added some photos of food that not only tasted amazing 
                  but looked the part for fun.</li>
